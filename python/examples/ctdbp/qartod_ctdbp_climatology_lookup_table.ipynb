    "# Changes in QARTOD Gross Range and Climatology Lookup Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "The lookup tables for gross range and climatology QARTOD tests on OOI CTDBP data were last updated on 12 Jan 2022, and the \"suspect\" ranges were calculated with all data before the cutoff date of 31 Dec 2021. However, when we recalculate these test ranges now, the values are different because recovered data that was recorded by the sensor before the cutoff date were recovered and ingested after the current lookup tables were published online. \n",
    "\n",
    "Deployment 14 of the Coastal Endurance array was the last deployment to be recovered before the cutoff date on 17 Sept 2021, so this is the last date that recovered instrument data was available for the original lookup tables. We can assume that deployment 14 data was included in the lookup table calculation since it was ingested on 18 Oct 2021. Since deployment 15 data was recovered 31 Mar 2022 and ingested xx xxx 2022, any gross range or climatology test ranges recalculated after 2023 with the same cutoff date will include additional recovered data from 17 Sept to 31 Dec 2021.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Note: We could change the cutoff date to 17 Sept 2021 when calling on the script to recalculate the lookup tables, and see if that would result in the same lookup table values.)"
