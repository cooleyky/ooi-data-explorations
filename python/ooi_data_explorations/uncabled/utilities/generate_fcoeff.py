    the WavesMon v4 processing utility, these files are no longer generated.
    This utility will recreate them so the data can be added to the OOI data

    original files were created using a different method than the one used
    here. The results are very similar, however, and as the original algorithm
    is not available, this is the best that can be done using a different
    method described in the CDIP document ADCPwaves2CDIP.pdf referenced below.
